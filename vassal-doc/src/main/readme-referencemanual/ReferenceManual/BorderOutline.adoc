=== Border Outline

Pieces which have the _Border Outline_ trait will automatically display a colored border around the piece's image. Specify the color and thickness of the border, and an optional property name to control whether the border is displayed. Note that if you use a NonRectangular trait to control your piece's shape, the outline will conform to the designated shape.

*Description:*:: A short description of this trait for your own reference.

*Property Name (or none for true):*:: A property which, if specified, must have a value other than 0, false, or the empty string for the border outline to be shown.

*Second Property Name (or none for true):*:: A second property which, if specified, must have a value other than 0, false, or the empty string in order for the outline to be shown. If both property names are left blank, the border outline will always be shown. If both property names are specified, then _both_ properties must be non-0, non-false, non-empty. If a single property name is specified (in either field), then only that property must be non-0, non-false, non-empty.

*Color:*:: The color of the border outline.

*Thickness:*:: The pixel thickness of the border outline.
